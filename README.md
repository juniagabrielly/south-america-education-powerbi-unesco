This dashboard was created to practice skills in Power BI and data analysis, as well as to improve my English proficiency by working with content in the language.
The data comes from the platform Our World in Data, which provides research and global development indicators. I chose educational data because I have an affinity for and interest in the topic.
The dashboard compares key indicators from several South American countries, including:
•	Internet access rate
•	Average years of schooling
•	Literacy rate
•	Government investment in education
At the top of the dashboard, there are filters for Year and Country, which are the only dimension tables and connect to all fact tables. Since many years lacked complete data for all countries, I filtered the dashboard to the period from 1996 to 2022 for more consistent analysis.
Just below the filters, there are 4 KPI cards showing the average rates of the four main educational indicators for the selected countries.
 Charts Used
•	Clustered column and line chart: Displays the average internet access rate by country (bars). The purple line shows the overall annual average (regardless of the selected country), making it possible to compare individual countries to the regional average. I highlighted Chile, which has led this indicator since 2015, by adding an orange line that represents the difference between Chile’s average internet access rate and the average of the other countries — working as a reference line to assess inequality.
•	Map with bubble chart: Provides a geographic view of the countries, with the bubble size representing public investment in education. Latitude and longitude data were manually added in Power Query and merged with the country dimension table.
•	Scatter plot (correlation chart): Illustrates the relationship between average years of schooling and the average literacy rate. Each point represents a South American country. The chart reveals that countries with higher average years of schooling also tend to have higher literacy rates — suggesting a moderate positive correlation between the two variables
This project was a great opportunity to apply Power BI concepts, data storytelling, and comparative analysis, while also developing data visualization skills and practicing English in a meaningful context. The analysis revealed important disparities among South American countries and reinforced the relevance of public policies focused on education and digital access.
